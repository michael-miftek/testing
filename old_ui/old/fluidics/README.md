# Fluidics

This folder contains the entire **Fluidics** UI and all other items that will be attached to the **Fluidics** UI. This UI and all UI/Services will be written in a way that they will be able to exist on their own; in each service folder there will be a `main.py` file that can be run as a stand alone service.
